# Custom Honeypot 

This project is a demonstration on how to set up your own honeypot environmental network that is used to capture incoming SSH connections onto that specific device. Docker is utilized in order to simulate different machines attempting to SSH into the honeypot. Finally, a SIEM software (Elasticsearch and Kibana) is used to display the SSH connections onto a GUI.
